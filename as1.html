HTML is used to create web pages and web applications.
HTML is widely used language on the web.
We can create a static website by HTML only.
Technically, HTML is a Markup language rather than a programming language.HTML, which stands for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used to create and design web pages. It defines the structure and layout of a web document by using a variety of tags and attributes to specify how content should be displayed on a web browser. HTML documents are composed of elements, each marked by tags that define the beginning and end of the element.
Key features and concepts of HTML include:Elements: These are the building blocks of HTML documents. They consist of a start tag, content, and an end tag. For example, <p> is the start tag for a paragraph element, and </p> is the end tag.Attributes: These provide additional information about HTML elements and are placed within the start tag of an element. Attributes typically include things like class,id,src,href,etc.Structure: HTML documents have a specific structure that includes an <!DOCTYPE> declaration at the beginning to indicate the HTML version, followed by <html> as the root element, <head> for metadata (like title, links to stylesheets, etc.), and <body> for the main content visible in the browser.</p>
